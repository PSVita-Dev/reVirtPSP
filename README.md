# reVirtPSP
Virtools for PSP!

# Issues:
-Textures aren't supported for now, because they need to be loaded from a weird .gim format and i dont know from where exactly!

(You can help if you want)

-The PSP Building blocks, those are needed to implement controls and other stuff, you can extract them from the game but they won't work.

# Credits:
-Unpakke project and the Syberia2 Extract and pack module
